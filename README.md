Its purpose is to establish a clear definition of the system's flows, objects, data types, and logical requirements. By outlining these key aspects, this document provides a solid foundation for the development and implementation of ***My Sport Time*** project.

# Project Definition

My Sport Time is a reservation software project specifically designed for sport coaches. This software aims to streamline the process of managing and scheduling sports activities, making it easier for coaches to coordinate with their customers and plan training sessions. With My Sport Time, coaches can efficiently manage their schedules, track attendance, and communicate important information to their athletes.

# Technical Configuration

# Users of the System

- **Customers**: Individuals who use the ***My Sport Time*** reservation software for their sports activities.
- **Guest:** Individuals who could browse My Sport Time data and see availabilities. For proceeding the payment flow, guests should register first and then could purchase a session.( the selected session data could be saved as cookie and after registration it could be submitted.)
- **Coaches**: Sports coaches who use the software to manage their training schedules, communicate with athletes, and track attendance.
- **Administrators**: Individuals in charge of overseeing the overall functionality and maintenance of the My Sport Time system.

# Key Flows of the System

## Users Registration

The registration process should include collecting necessary user information such as **name**, **email**, and **password**.

## Customers-Coaches Match Making

This allows customers to find coaches who specialize in their specific sport and can offer training sessions that align with their needs and goals. Customers can consider factors like location and coach availability to find a convenient training option.

## Coach Calendar & Event Management

Coaches should have a calendar feature to manage schedules. They can **add training sessions, events**, and **availability slots**.

## Training Session Booking

Customers should be able to book training sessions with coaches through the system. The booking process should allow customers to select a **specific date** and **time**. Real-time availability information should be provided. Confirmation notifications should be sent to both customers and coaches via **email**. Customers should have the option to **cancel** or **reschedule** sessions.

## Payment Integration

The system should integrate a **payment gateway** for customers to make payments for their booked sessions. The payment integration should support various methods.

## Reporting and Analytics

The system should generate **comprehensive reports** and **analytics** for **administrators**, **coaches**, and **customers**. Administrators can access reports on **session attendance**, **revenue**, and **overall performance**. Coaches and customers can access reports on **booking schedules**.

‚úÖ **QUESTION 13:** The cancellation process by customer is unclear [[figma]](https://www.figma.com/file/dfBqqZgc7Lyh1a7KPp9ZXo/My-Sport-Times?type=design&node-id=1107-1118&mode=design&t=Ur0SapC3vj8jdrU5-0). Is cancellation a different flow of refunding?
Also there is a rules explanation in the page that seems to be for coach, not customer. Could you please clarify this section?
Rules explanation quote from the page:

*If you cancel your session more than 48 hours in advance, you're entitled to a full refund minus transaction fees.*

*For cancellations made 24 to 48 hours before, a 50% refund applies, also minus transaction fees. Unfortunately, cancellations made less than 24 hours prior to the session cannot be refunded.

**ANSWER:** Refund is for past bookings, cancel is for upcoming bookings. cancel is automatic, refund is manual. Also refunds should be emailed to admins.
Cancellation Rules should be clarified in a meeting.*
